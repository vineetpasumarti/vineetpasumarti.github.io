                <p>The objective of this lab was to deploy a quadrotor controller, waypoint planner, and trajectory
                    generator on real hardware.</p>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>In our first lab session, we implemented both a controller and waypoint planner on a CrazyFlie 2.0.
                    We first validated the quadrotor's stability with a hover, then tuned our controller's $z$ position
                    gain using an altitude step response. We then tuned $x$ and $y$ position gains using a lateral step
                    response. We evaluated our controller against a test ``box'' maneuver, and with our extra lab time
                    we wrote our own test waypoints to fly the drone in a rectangular spiral and land.
                </p>

                <p>In our second lab session, we deployed our stack on the CrazyFlie to plan a path through a maze and
                    execute the resulting trajectory. This required us to re-evaluate our gains and fine-tune the
                    margins of our occupancy map to ensure the safe traversal of the drone from start to finish.
                    Following both sessions, we were able to demonstrate successful control and flight path generation.
                    Tuning parameters on real hardware allowed us to be less risk-averse and execute more aggressive
                    trajectories that navigate the cluttered environment faster and smoother.</p>

                <p>
                    The CrazyFlie 2.0 is a palm-sized quadrotor that we cover with markers to be tracked by a VICON
                    system. VICON is a motion capture system that uses multiple infrared cameras to track the position
                    and orientation of an object. The quadrotor's position and orientation are tracked by the VICON and
                    the angular velocity and acceleration from the onboard accelerometer and gyroscope are all radio
                    transmitted to the lab computers. This information is fed to our controller as an input, which runs
                    on the lab computers to generate a desired state and the necessary motor commands are then
                    transmitted back to the quadrotor.
                </p>

                <h3>Methodology</h3>

                <p>The controller we elected to use for our experiments was a geometric nonlinear controller. In an
                    intuitive sense, the controller is structured around the idea of orienting the quadrotor's z-axis in
                    the direction we desire to move to. This controller allows for aggressive maneuvers and requires
                    fine-tuning of both the damping and gain. Using the Project 1.1 handout as a reference, we will
                    define the theoretical framework of the controller. We start with the PD controller equation: </p>

                <p>
                    \[\ddot{r}^{des} = \ddot{r}_T - K_d(\dot{r}-\dot{r}_T) -K_p(r-r_T)\]
                </p>

                <p>
                    To compute the inputs $u_1$ and $u_2$ in order to generate our desired acceleration we use the
                    following equation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    \[m\ddot{r}^{des} + \begin{bmatrix}
                    0\\0\\mg
                    \end{bmatrix} = u_1R\begin{bmatrix}
                    0\\0\\1
                    \end{bmatrix}\]
                </p>

                <p>We can identify that the left hand side of the equation is simply the desired force combined with the
                    gravitational force. Thus, we can simplify the equation in order to solve for $u_1$ as follows:</p>

                <p>\[F^{des} = m\ddot{r}^{des} + \begin{bmatrix}
                    0\\0\\1
                    \end{bmatrix}\]
                    \[u_1 = R\begin{bmatrix}
                    0\\0\\1
                    \end{bmatrix}F^{des}\]:</p>

                <p>Calculating $u_2$ requires a slightly more complex process. Based off of the previously laid out
                    intuition, we seek to align the thrust vector with the quadrotor's z-axis. Thus,</p>

                <p>\[c_3^{des} = \frac{F^{des}}{||F^{des}||}\]</p>

                <p>
                    Next, we seek to align the quadrotor's y-axis with the desired yaw direction while maintaining the
                    orthogonality between the y and x-axes. To do so, we first define the following term:
                </p>

                <p>
                    \[a_\psi = \begin{bmatrix}
                    cos\psi_T\\sin\psi_T\\0
                    \end{bmatrix}\]
                </p>

                <p>
                    this vector represents the yaw direction in the world x-y plane. Next, we can calculate the y-axis
                    vector as follows:
                </p>

                <p>
                    \[c_2^{des} = \frac{c_3^{des}\times a_\psi}{||c_3^{des}\times a_\psi||}\]
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, we can define the desired $R^{des}$
                </p>

                <p>
                    \[R^{des} = \begin{bmatrix}
                    c_2^{des} \times c_3^{des}, & c_2^{des}, & c_3^{des}
                    \end{bmatrix}\]
                </p>

                <p>
                    This rotation matrix represents the desired orientation we wish to achieve at a given time step. The
                    next step is to measure the error between our current and desired orientation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    \[e_R = \frac{1}{2}(R^{des^T}R - R^TR^{des})^\vee\]
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another aspect of control we may care about is the difference between our desired and current
                    angular velocities. We can easily define this term as:
                </p>

                <p>
                    \[e_\omega = \omega - \omega^{des}\]
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, we can define $u_2$ as:
                </p>

                <p>
                    \[u_2 = I(-K_Re_R - K_\omega e_\omega)\]
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using this controller, we have four tunable gains that we had to first meticulously tune in
                    simulation and then finalize in our experiments. After tuning our controller, in simulation, lab 1,
                    and lab 2 we settled on the following configuration. The 1x3 vector listed in Table \ref{tab:Tune
                    table} represents the diagonal of a 3x3 matrix.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Intuitively, we interpreted the gains as ways to answer four different questions. Starting with
                    $K_p$, we viewed this metric as measuring `how important is it to to achieve a desired position?'.
                    $K_d$ is the measure of `how fast do you want to get to the desired position?'. Similarly, we can
                    say that $K_R$ measures `how important is it to achieve a desired orientation?' and $K_\omega$
                    measures `how fast do you want to achieve the desired orientation?'.This intuition provided us a
                    steady foundation to work off of and fine tune our parameters. It was fairly easy to tinker with
                    each gain to reach our desired performance. However, we immediately noticed that testing on hardware
                    required us to scale down our gains by around 30$\%$. Additional fine-tuning during lab 1 and 2
                    narrowed us down to our final parameters. We can attribute the differences in gains due to model
                    mismatch, lack of simulation fidelity, and flaws in our controller implementation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Figure \ref{fig:tuning tests} shows an experiment we ran to tune our y-direction gain and damping
                    parameters. Based on the plots, we can determine that our controller demonstrates a settling time of
                    around 2 s, a rise time of around 1.1 s, a steady state error of around 2$\%$, and a damping ratio
                    of around 0.4. This experiment revealed a few flaws in our controller. First and foremost, the
                    controller is underdamped and takes fairly long to settle into a steady state. Secondly, we
                    immediately recognized a glaring issue in our z-direction tuning. At first, we attributed the
                    discrepancy in desired and actual position as model mismatch, but in lab 2 we retuned our z gains to
                    fix this issue. The process of fine-tuning the gains was straightforward as we would conduct a test,
                    adjust the parameters, and repeat until we were satisfied.
                </p>

                <h3>Trajectory Generation</h3>

                <p>
                    In this section, we discuss the approach for the generation of a piecewise trajectory connecting the
                    waypoints from start to target for an input map in the discretized occupancy grid, as well as a
                    method that generates an optimized flight path that aligns with the quadrotor's maneuverability
                    while maintaining collision-free.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Starting with the default \texttt{occupancy\_map} file where a 3D occupancy map is generated from
                    the given map environment by splitting the space into a grid of voxels at a given axial resolution,
                    the occupancy map consists of voxels that are marked ``occupied'' when they intersect an obstacle or
                    hit the boundary within the workspace, and others representing the discretized waypoints that are
                    open access to the graph search planner.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then, the \texttt{graph\_search} treats each unoccupied voxel from the previous map as a node in a
                    graph, which is able to develop up to 26 edges connecting its neighbors in 3D. During the lab
                    execution, an A* graph search algorithm is preferred over the plain Dijkstra method, since it
                    incorporates a heuristic measure, which is the straight-line distance to the goal, to guide the
                    search more efficiently. This heuristic attracts the exploration toward the target node,
                    significantly reducing the exploration time to find an optimal path compared to Dijkstra, which
                    blindly develops its path outward. To conclude, the cost of moving between neighboring nodes is the
                    Euclidean distance [\(l_2\ norm\)], while an admissible heuristic \(h(n)\) estimates the cost from
                    the current node to the goal.
                </p>

                <p>
                    \[
                    c(\text{current}, \text{neighbor}) \;=\; \bigl\lVert \text{neighbor} - \text{current} \bigr\rVert,
                    \]
                    \[
                    h(n) \;=\; \bigl\lVert n - \text{goal} \bigr\rVert.
                    \]
                    The total cost at each node is therefore:
                    \[
                    f(n) \;=\; g(n) + h(n),
                    \]
                    where \(g(n)\) represents the cost so far from the start node to the current.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After running A*, we apply the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker (RDP) algorithm to reduce redundant points
                    along nearly straight segments. An RDP tolerance of
                    \(\varepsilon = 0.1\,\text{m}\) is used, which prunes interior waypoints whose perpendicular
                    distance to the line between the first and last point in a subset is below \(\varepsilon\). The
                    outcome is a sparser set of critical waypoints, preserving the overall path shape but removing
                    unnecessary intermediate points that might complicate maneuvering along the trajectory. We construct
                    a piecewise linear position trajectory to connect along each optimized waypoint, commanding the
                    quadrotor to operate from start to goal. The position where each single segment ends is:
                </p>

                <p>
                    \[
                    \mathbf{x}(t) \;=\; \mathbf{p}_i
                    \;+\; \bigl(\mathbf{v}_i\bigr)\,\bigl(t - t_{\mathrm{start},\,i}\bigr),
                    \quad t \in [t_{\mathrm{start},\,i},\, t_{\mathrm{start},\,i} + T_i],
                    \]
                    where \(\mathbf{v}_i\) is a constant velocity vector for segment \(i\), defined by
                    \[
                    \mathbf{v}_i \;=\; v_i \,\frac{\mathbf{p}_{i+1} - \mathbf{p}_i}{\|\mathbf{p}_{i+1} -
                    \mathbf{p}_i\|}.
                    \]
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hence, velocity is constant in each segment, and the position changes linearly from \(\mathbf{p}_i\)
                    to \(\mathbf{p}_{i+1}\). Once \(t\) exceeds \(t_{\mathrm{start},i}+T_i\), we switch to the next
                    segment \(i+1\) until the Crazyflie hits the target. In our code, \(v_i\) is chosen based on the
                    segment length and the angular change between consecutive segments (with mild speed reductions if
                    there is a sharp turn). The total trajectory time becomes
                </p>

                <p>
                    \[
                    T_{\mathrm{total}} \;=\; \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} T_i.
                    \]
                    where a constant speed \(v_i\) for each segment
                    \(\bigl[\mathbf{p}_i \rightarrow \mathbf{p}_{i+1}\bigr]\) is:
                    \[
                    T_i \;=\; \frac{\|\mathbf{p}_{i+1} - \mathbf{p}_i\|}{v_i}.
                    \]
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since each segment uses constant velocity, the overall trajectory is only continuous in position
                    (\(C^0\)-continuous); velocity changes instantaneously at segment boundaries. However, we limit the
                    speed of the Crazyflie to under 1 m/s, which prevents aggressive maneuvering during the tests. By
                    including an obstacle inflation margin of \(0.2\,\text{m}\) and a resolution of the occupancy grid
                    of \(\Delta x = \Delta y = \Delta z = 0.25\,\text{m}\), we ensure that the resulting waypoints
                    remain safely away from obstacles while keeping a low computational load. Hence, while the
                    piecewise-linear approach does not strictly enforce higher-order continuity, it is straightforward
                    to implement, fast to compute, and guarantees collision-free given the flight map. The plots below
                    show (1) discrete waypoints and path, (2) 3D quadrotor trajectory, and (3) position, velocity, and
                    acceleration log in the map \texttt{maze\_2025\_1}.

                <h3>Maze Flight Experiments</h3>

                <p>
                    We observe discrepancies between the planned trajectory and actual flight path in all three maps,
                    especially during sharp turns and maneuevers around obstacles. One possible cause for the tracking
                    error comes from the motor thrust limitations. The maximum thrust capabilities of the flight motors
                    restricted the drone's response to control inputs during high-demand maneuvers, leading to larger
                    than anticipated deviations from the planned path. In addition, interruptions in positional data due
                    to occlusions of VICON cameras by obstacles resulted in inaccurate state estimations, causing the
                    drone to stray off course. The discrepancies between the simulated and actual weight of the drone
                    can be another cause, it led to inadequate PID controller settings and impacting the drone's dynamic
                    response to control commands. To achieve safe trajectories, we can directly adjust the trajectory
                    planning algorithm to include larger safety margins around obstacles, accounting for potential
                    hardware limitation during path planning. We can also further adjust PID parameters using actual
                    drone weight data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since we have already observed undesired flight paths, it can be dangerous to make the trajectory
                    more aggressive. The limited maximum thrust of the flight motors restricted the drone's ability to
                    execute rapid or steep maneuvers, essential for more aggressive trajectories. The observed
                    inaccuracies in positional data due to VICON camera occlusions and the lack of precise PID tuning
                    for the actual drone weight meant that increasing the aggressiveness of the trajectories could lead
                    to higher risks of collision or loss of control.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To improve the system reliability and speed, one change we can make is tune the PID using real world
                    data to reduce the discrepancy between simulated trajectory and actual pathways. A more robust
                    trajectory planning algorithm can also improve the system reliability and speed, with higher
                    dimension spline fitting, the trajectory can be smooth and reduce the potential issue with motor
                    torque limitations. Incorporate higher resolution in path planning is another effective approach to
                    enhance both the speed and reliability of the drone system. This allows the trajectory to be
                    optimized at a more detailed level, enabling smoother transitions and tighter navigation around
                    obstacles.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If we had one more session in the lab to do something interesting, it will be interesting to try
                    implementing more advanced control techniques with PID controller parameters dynamically based on
                    observed performance metrics and environmental conditions encountered during flight. The goal would
                    be to see how well the drone can optimize its flight stability and accuracy in response to
                    dynamically changing conditions within the maze, potentially leading to more reliable and efficient
                    navigation.
